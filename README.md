# Gradle Cucumber-JVM Plugin

The gradle cucumber-jvm plugin provides the ability to run [cucumber](http://cukes.info) acceptance tests directly
from a gradle build.  The plugin utilizes the cucumber cli provided by the [cucumber-jvm](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm) 
project, while imposing a few constraints to encourage adopters to use cucumber in a gradle friendly manner. Some of
constraints include:

*   A Cucumber test suite should be contained in a single source set
*   Glue code should be compiled by gradle and use annotations to glue to the features
*   Features should be in the resources folder of the source set representing the test suite.
*   This plugin generates Cucumber reports based on [masterthought's Cucumber reporting project](https://github.com/masterthought/cucumber-reporting)

The inspiration for this plugin drew heavily from the work of 
[Samuel Brown's Cucumber Plugin](https://github.com/samueltbrown/gradle-cucumber-plugin) and 
[Camilo Ribeiro's Cucumber Gradle Parallel Example](https://github.com/camiloribeiro/cucumber-gradle-parallel).

## Using the plugin in your gradle build script


The following gradle configuration will create a new Cucumber based test suite named *cucumberTest* and configure it 
to run up to 3 parallel forks. The *cucumberTest* source set will depend on the project's main source set.

    buildscript {
        repositories {
            maven {
                url "http://repo.bodar.com"
            }
            jcenter()
        }
        dependencies {
            classpath 'com.commercehub:gradle-cucumber-jvm-plugin:0.3'
        }
    }
    apply plugin: 'java'            
    apply plugin: 'cucumber-jvm'

      
    addCucumberSuite 'cucumberTest'
      
    cucumber {
        maxParallelForks = 3
    }
    
    cucumberTest {
        stepDefinitionRoots = ['cucumber.steps', 'cucumber.hooks']
    }
    
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    
    dependencies {
        cucumberTestCompile 'info.cukes:cucumber-java:1.2.2'
    }

Running the following command will execute the test suite:

    gradle(w) cucumberTest


## Cucumber Task Configuration

Cucumber tasks can be configured at two levels, globally for the project and individually for a test suite. This allows
for projects to contain multiple Cucumber test suites that can differ on some properties while inheriting other
property values form the project defaults. Both levels of configuration make the following settings available:

* `stepDefinitionRoots`: A list of root packages to scan the classpath for glue code. Default to **['cucumber.steps', 'cucumber.hooks']**
* `featureRoots`: A list of root packages to scan the resources folders on the classpath for feature files. Defaults to **['features']**
* `tags`: A list of tags to identify scenarios to run. Default to an empty list.
* `isStrict`: A boolean value indicating whether scenarios should be evaluated strictly. Defaults to **false**
* `snippits`: Indicator to cucumber on what style to use for generated step examples. Legal values include camelcase, underscore. Defaults to **camelcase**
* `maxParallelForks`: Maximum number of forked Java processes to start to run tests in parallel. Default to **1**

### Reporting

By default, this plugin will generate reports based on [masterthought's Cucumber reporting project](https://github.com/masterthought/cucumber-reporting). 

Junit reporting can be enabled by setting the `junitReport` property to true.
